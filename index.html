                    <h2> A Short Self Indulgent Monologue on Data and the Universe </h2>
                    <p> Ok so get this, the universe operates in an infinitely nested set of relationships, an unending waltz of energy
                    and time in 3 dimensional space that recursively defines our world and us. Or something like that. Data is a glimpse of that dance, a quick peek
                    at one of the infinite contracts that defines a nutty and complicated existence. Whether it’s a relationship in space, time,
                    or number of beans eaten in an hour, every set of data has something to say about how the world works. This data can come from anything
                    from the lights and colors you see to the people you talk to and the books you read. For some reason we can yank our experience out 
                    of reality and abstract things into concepts. After a while we began to recognize this and got smarter about how we could experience the 
                    world. We began to organize information into concepts and developed fancy pants ways of representing data through time instead of in our 
                    heads; like books and pictures and other new fangled techonolgy </p>
                    <p> Surprisingly enough, trying to keep track of or understand infinite interconnected seldom-discrete relationships isn't easy.
                    The observable universe is saturated with data and trying to parse it is probably the oldest and most persistent battle in
                    human history. There's just too much shit man. In the information age, we have the ability to process and apprehend these relationships much further than
                    the efforts of our computerless ancestors. Rather than trying to brute force a set of data or observations with sheer attention
                    and time (and the occasional stroke of genius), we now have the means to intelligently manipulate and present data in a way
                    that more clearly demonstrates that data’s statement on the universe. </p>
                    <p> Through computer graphics we can process and display reality in ways that enable us to recognize trends and patterns (essences,
                    if you will) of these relationships. We can transform observation into insight within a transcendent visual language that
                    is intuitive and easy to communicate. Our scientific, economic, and mathematical research can be understood at new levels.
                    The innate rhetoric of scale, depth, color, and other aspects of the visual world; communicate ideas on a level that is much
                    closer to our biological hardware. </p>
                    <p>  Data visualization
                    has and will continue to change everything about the spread of ideas from classroom to conference to research lab. I have
                    come to suspect that smarter data visualization methods and software is the key to moving forward in understanding and uniting
                    our universal model. By presenting data in a particular way we are able to view a reality through a different lens, we gain
                    a new perspective and new truths of the same reality. Working in data visualization involves stripping data to a more intuitive
                    core and abnormal translation of information. Computer Science and fantastic books
                    like “Gӧdel, Escher, Bach”, have made me fall in love with information theory, or at the very least it's cool enough to incentivize 
                    me to put up with all these godamn nerds. </p>
